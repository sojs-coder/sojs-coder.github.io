          Since 2017, every project I have made has begun as a dream. The music
          I hear comes from the orchestra I conduct in the cloud. Each project
          is a chance to create something that I can truly be proud of,
          something that, even if it fails, I can learn from and grow.

        <p>
          Arguably my greatest and most successful achievement, CCPorted was
          created one day during a slow high school english class. Through this
          bordem, a muse came to me in vision. "What if I could play some games
          on my computer right now?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocked, however, by the school administration's view on what
          constitutes acceptable use of technology, I decided that enough was
          enough, and built CCPorted, which deploys hundreds of games to many
          different domains to specifically target students.

        <h4>Forge Engine</h4>
        <Tags tags={["GCP", "Supabase", "TS", "HTML", "CSS", "JS"]} />
        <p>
          When building CCPorted, I struggled to quickly develop original games.
          I tried many different game engines, but I found that for most HTML
          games, the quickest way to quickly get up and running was to use my
          own custom engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, however, got tiresome, as I had to rewrite the same base
          functionality over and over again for many games. Thus, Forge Engine
          was born, for quickly "Forge" HTML games. The engine is based on the
          concept of a node tree, where each node represents a piece of
          functionality. Tying these nodes together allows you to quickly create
          any number of games with very little code or time.

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <h4>AdHoc</h4>
        <p>
          In my struggle to monetize my projects and my desire to create a
          platform where publishers and advertisers could easily advertise and
          monetize their content, I created AdHoc, a privacy-first advertising
          platform, built on the principles of user consent and data protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, user consent is not even implemented, because there is
          nothing for the user to consent to! No tracking scripts, no cookies,
          no data collection. Just pure advertising based on the content of the
          site and the content of the ad.
        </p>
        <p>
          AdHoc is still under development, and multiple clients are lined up to
          start using the platform as soon as it is completed.
